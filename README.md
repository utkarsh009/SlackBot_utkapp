# SlackBot_utkapp
This is the code for creating a Slack Bot. All of the code is designed to be deployed on Amazon Web services using the Serverless Architecture.
Readme will be up soon. I am still working on it. Do note that some of the confidential data has been changed in the serverless.yml file to XXXXXX. Please put appropriate data by replacing it.
A few things remain as TODO: 

1. Redirecting upon successful authorisation of app.

2. Returning an error message upon using wrong codes for currencies.

Also, do note that you will have to install the requests python module in the app directory using pip before deploying it.
